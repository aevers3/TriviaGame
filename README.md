# TriviaGame
## Welcome to Planet Trivia!

This is a simple trivia game with 10 multiple choice questions. Each question has 15-second timer onscreen. If the timer runs out, the answer choices will vanish and the user cannot earn a point on the question. Once the timer reaches 5 seconds, the font size becomes slightly larger and red.

The questions are stored as objects containing the question itself, an array of answer choices, and the index of the correct answer within that array. The quiz is dynamically generated on the fly, so the quiz can easily accomodate content updates and additions.

The user score is tallied as the quiz is completed, and is displayed onscreen.

To get started, simply load index.html and prove your trivia knowledge!
